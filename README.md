# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React Component

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply to a React component despite seemingly correct implementation. The issue is resolved by ensuring the parent element has the correct `className` attribute.

## Bug Description

A React component uses Tailwind CSS classes, but the styles are not being applied. The classes are correctly imported and referenced, and there are no apparent syntax errors.  The problem is isolated to a particular component and does not affect other parts of the application.

## Solution

The solution involves verifying that the parent element of the component receiving the Tailwind classes is also correctly styled and that the Tailwind directives are correctly configured in the parent element. The issue may be related to incorrect application of `className` attribute.
